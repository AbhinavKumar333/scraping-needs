(e) a reflex angle? Why or why not?",NA,"(a) Yes, we can have two acute angles whose sum is an acute angle.

We know that,

Acute angle is one that measures between 0° and 90°.

So, suppose we have two acute angles 30° and 40° then, sum of these two would be 70° and this lies between 0° and 90° therefore 70° is also acute .

You can think of more such examples.

[Note: basically, when two consider two acute angles smaller than 45° then their sum would always be smaller than 90° and so angle obtained will be acute.]

(b) Yes, we can have two acute angles whose sum is a right angle.

Example: 30° + 60° = 90°

45° + 45° = 90°

(c) Yes, we can have two acute angles whose sum is an obtuse angle.

We know that,

Acute angle is one that measures between 0° and 90°.

And obtuse angle is one that measures between 90° and 180°.

So, suppose we have two acute angles 50° and 60° then, sum of these two would be 110° and this lies between 90° and 180° therefore 110° is an obtuse angle .

You can think of more such examples.

[Note: basically, when two consider two acute angles greater than 45° then their sum would always be greater than 90° and so angle obtained will be obtuse.]

(d) No, we can have two acute angles whose sum is a straight angle.

We know that,

Acute angle is one that measures between 0° and 90°.

And straight angle measures 180°

If we take two 90° angles then we can obtain a straight angle but 90° is not an acute angle. So, in any case we cannot obtain a straight angle using two acute angles.

[Note: measure of acute angle is always less than 90° and on adding two 90° angles we are obtaining a straight angle. So, if we add any other acute angles then their sum would always be less than 180°.]

(e) No, we can have two acute angles whose sum is a straight angle.

We know that,

Acute angle is one that measures between 0° and 90°.

And reflex angle measures between 180° and 360°

If we take two 90° angles then we can obtain a 180° angle but 90° is not an acute angle. So, in any case we cannot obtain an angle which is greater than 180° (or a reflex angle).

A. If we compare two negative integers on the number line, then the number which is on the left to the other number, is the smaller number.

B. If we compare two positive integers on the number line, then the number which is on the left to the other number, is the smaller number.

C. On the number line positive numbers lie on the right of zero and negative numbers lie on the left of zero. So, negative numbers is always on the left of the positive numbers, hence negative numbers are always smaller than positive numbers.

As we can see in the figure, there are two circles, when we divide the circles into two halves we get 4 parts. Therefore both the circles are divided into 4 halves.

Now when we divide these 4 parts again we will get 8 parts as we can see in the figure.

Now we can see that 6 sub parts are shaded out of 4 intitial half of the circle therefore we get the fraction as

As we can see in the figure from 0 to 2 it is sub divided into 10 parts. Out of these 10 parts 6 parts are shaded so we get the fraction as

Perimeter for any figure is the sum of all sides.

When two hexagons are joined, each side of each hexagon overlaps.


So total number of sides of the new figure is 10.

(iv) What will be the expenditure for making 23 boards, if the carpenter charges Rs x per board.",NA,"(i) We have to frame the perimeter of the board hence length of aluminium strip required to frame the board will be same as perimeter of board Perimeter of board = 2 × (r + t)

But 10 cm extra strip is required to fix it properly hence we should add 10 to perimeter of board

Therefore, aluminium strip required to frame the board is 2 × (r + t) + 10 cm

(ii) Number of nails required to repair 1 board = x

Number of nails to repair 15 boards = 15 × Number of nails required to repair 1 board

Number of nails to repair 15 boards = 15 × x = 15x

(iii) Area of one board = r × t sq. cm

500 sq. cm extra cloth is required per board so we should add 500 in area of one board to get the total area of cloth required for one board

Area of cloth required for one board = Area of one board + 500 sq. cm

Therefore, Area of cloth required for one board = (r × t) + 500 sq. cm

Area of cloth required for 8 boards = 8 × Area of cloth required for one board

Area of cloth required for 8 boards = 8 × [(r × t) + 500]

(i) The number of corners of a quadrilateral

Let it be any quadrilateral the number of corners will always be constant example for a square the number of corners are 4 which is constant which won’t change

(ii) The variable in the equation 2p + 3 = 5

A variable is a letter which can take any value in equation here ‘p’ can take any value hence the variable is ‘p’

(iii) The solution of the equation x + 2 = 3

To find x take the 2 on the right hand side which will become -2 on going to the right as shown

x = 3 – 2


therefore, solution of the equation x + 2 = 3 is x = 1

(iv) solution of the equation 2p + 3 = 5

To find x take the 3 on the right hand side which will become -3 on going to the right as shown

2p = 5 – 3

2p = 2


p = 1

Therefore, solution of the equation 2p + 3 = 5 is p = 1

As the units are different we cannot directly take the ratio to take ratio we need to have two quantities with same units

1 m = 100 cm

1.2 m = 1.2 × 100 = 120 cm

Length of paper = 120 cm

Divide numerator and denominator by 13

Ratio of their costs = …(i)

Weight of mixture = 84 kg

Let the weight of type ‘A’ tea in the mixture be ‘a’ and as total is 84 the weight of type ‘B’ tea would be (84 – a)

Now given that the ratio of two varieties of tea in the mixture is same as the ratio of their costs

Using (i) and given condition


Cross multiply

9 × (84 – a) = 5a
