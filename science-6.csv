First
we will use decantation method to separate oil and water. Water being heavier, forms the lower layer and oil being lighter forms the upper layer in the beaker. We can decant off the upper layer of oil into another beaker carefully.
Then by the process of filtration sand can be separated from water. The filtrate obtained contains the mixture of salt and water. The salt dissolved in water can be separated by the process of evaporation. The water present in the salt solution and then the salt is left behind.

Iron nails are separated from the mixture by using magnets. Then by using decantation oil and water is separated. Oil being lighter forms the upper layer in the beaker and we can decant off the upper layer of oil.
Now the mixture contains dissolved salt and water. Salt can be obtained from the water by the process of evaporation. The water present in the salt solution will form water vapor and then the salt is left behind.

(b) When will this activity show better result – on a bright sunny day or a cloudy day?
(c) What will you observed in the polythene bag after a few hours of setting up the activity?
(d) Mention any one precaution you must take while performing this activity.
",NA,"(a) The leaves of plants give out water constantly in the form of water vapour (which goes into air). So the process demonstrated in the activity is transpiration.
(b) This activity will show better result on sunny day because rate of transpiration is maximum in the presence of sunlight.
(c) After a few hours of the setting of the activity, we can see a number of water droplets on the inner side of polythene bag because the leaves are enclosed in the polythene bag, the water vapour cannot escape into air. So the water vapour given out by the covered leaves keeps on colleting inside the polythene bag. Some of these water vapour condenses to form tiny drops of water.
(d) While performing this activity we need to take some precautions. The polythene bag used should be clean and dry and it should be sealed properly so that no air passes inside it.

To stay away from the intense heat, desert snakes
burrow deep into the sand during the day and come out only during the night, when it is cooler.

There can be three main causes of errors in measurement:
● Defect in instrument can lead to error in measurement. Different instruments can have little differences. So, they can cause errors.

D. all bulbs will glow together.
","To answer this type of question we have to fully understand the concept as well as the question. The question here wants to ask which bulb will glow first. The key concept here is that for a bulb to glow the circuit must be complete. Only when the bulb will glow. Option (a) states that bulb A will glow but the bulb A will not glow until the circuit completes. And if the circuit completes, all bulb will glow together because all are connected to each other. The circuit process in following steps:
● Current leaves from the positive terminal.
● Current enters the bulb A, but the circuit is not complete, hence bulb does not glow.
● Current enters the bulb B, but the circuit is not complete, hence bulb does not glow.
● Current enters the bulb C, but the circuit is still not complete hence bulb does not glow.
● But when the current enters the negative terminal the circuit completes and all the bulb will glow at once.
The simple logic here is that all bulb will help to complete the circuit, that is why the current will flow through them at the same time and hence they will glow together.

Terminals are those part through which the electricity is passed to the filament of the bulb. They are made up of metal because their work is to conduct electricity to the filament. Terminals are like gates, if you want to go inside the room there is only one way that is passing through the gate. In case of bulb, if you want to enter the current into the filament you must pass it through the terminals. Without passing through terminals there is no other way.

Steps to show the connections to make the bulb glow:-
● There are two terminals of an electric cell. Connect the positive terminal of the electric cell to one terminal of the switch by the given connecting wires. Current starts from the positive terminal and passes through the switch.
● Now, connect the second terminal of the switch to the one terminal of the bulb by connecting wires. The current passes through the switch and bulb but still the circuit is not complete, so the bulb will not glow.
● The last step is to connect the other terminal of the bulb to the negative terminal of the cell. This completes the electric circuit, as current starts from positive terminal goes to switch, if switch is close it goes to bulb and then it completes the circuit by going to the negative terminal. This make the complete electric circuit.

",NA,"● The first possible reason is that may be the filament inside the bulb is broken. Filament is the main component of the bulb which glows when the current passes through it. It glows because when electricity passes through the filament it got heat up. Heating causes the glowing of bulb. But the extensive heating can break the filament and will result in not glowing of the bulb.
● The second possible reason is that the electric cell is completely used up or all the chemicals have been used already and there is no electricity left in it. As cell is the only source of the power of the circuit, if it is completely used the circuit will not work and the bulb will not glow.

The current start from the positive terminal of the cell and will come up back into the negative terminal of the cell
.
If a bulb require three electric cell the most important thing is how you arrange the cell. The correct arrangement is that when positive terminal of one cell is attached to the negative terminal of the another.
Now, it will work like current from one cell will leave and will enter into another cell {from negative terminal of the second cell} there it will add with the current of second cell and they both will leave {from positive terminal of the second cell} and then they will enter into third cell{ through the negative terminal of the third cell} after that all the current sum up and will go into the circuit from the positive terminal of the third cell.
The key point here is Current can leaves from positive terminal of the cell only and enter into cell from negative terminal, we have to fulfill these two condition to make this arrangement.

The iron bar can be used as a magnet as it has induced some magnetic properties from the bar magnet present there. The pin cannot be used as a magnet as it has very small area and as it is not in direct contact with the magnet, the magnetic strength is very less. Therefore it cannot induce magnetic properties.
Steps to show that they have/have not induced magnetic properties are:
● Place the iron bar & pin on the table just after it is being separated from the magnet.
● Now use iron fillings and spread it over the iron bar and the pin.
● We will infer that iron bar attracts some iron fillings but not the pin.

Plant contains the stomata. Stomata are minute pores present on epidermics of leave and are meant for gaseous exchange (respiratory gasses) and transpiration. Oxygen and carbon dioxide enters into the plant through the stomata and are used in respiration and photosythesis.
(b) True
The amount of oxygen produced by the plant during photosynthesis is more than the amount of oxygen consume by the plant during respiration. Plant produce oxygen during photosynthesis and consume oxygen during respiration. Plant take the carbon dioxide through the leaves(stomata) and combined it with water and sunlight to form their food(glucose). During this process oxygen is also formed as a byproduct. Which is relased into the atmosphere.
(c) False
Air helps in the movements of sailing yachts and glider as well as it (air) also play an important role in the flight of birds and aeroplanes.
(d) False
Air occupies every space that is available to it. Air is everywhere.
